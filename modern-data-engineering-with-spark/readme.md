# Modern Data Engineering with Apache Spark

This hands-on guidebook teaches how to write fully functional applications using Apache Spark as the foundation and follow industry best practices while learning the rationale behind these decisions. Readers will follow a step-by-step journey beginning with the basics of data ingestion, processing, and transformation, and ending up with an entire local data platform running Apache Spark, Apache Zeppelin, Apache Kafka, Redis, MySQL, Minio (S3), and Apache Airflow. The book covers Spark Pipelines and Spark SQL, building reusable application components and libraries, and containerizing Spark applications for consistency and reliability. Additionally, readers will learn how to deploy and monitor Spark applications using Docker and Kubernetes, and build end-to-end Spark structured streaming applications using Redis and Apache Kafka. The book is intended for professional software engineers, practicing data engineers, data architects, and those interested in becoming a modern data engineer.
