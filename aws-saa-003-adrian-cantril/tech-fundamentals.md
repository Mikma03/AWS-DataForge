# Cloud Computing Fundamentals

## Cloud Computing - what is it...really

Cloud Computing isn't a buzzword - it's a unique type of computing which has a formal set of definitions.

This lesson aims to dispel the jargon, and step through what makes cloud ... cloud.

## Public vs Private vs Multi vs Hybrid Cloud

Understanding what Public Cloud, Private Cloud, Hybrid Cloud and Muti Cloud are is a hugely under rated skill.

More and more larger AWS deployments are requiring a level of bespoke deployment and locational efficiency that only Hybrid cloud can provide, or a level of cloud vendor resilience only achievable with Multi Cloud.

As an AWS solutions architect understanding what IS, and what ISN'T Public, Private, Hybrid and Multi cloud will help in the Exam and in real-world usage.

This lesson steps through the key points of all four types of cloud.

## Cloud Service Models

Cloud Service models define what service you receive from a product.

It defines which parts of the infrastructure stack you are responsible for and which the vendor manages.

They define your unit of consumption - which is the thing you pay for.

As a Service Model Examples : https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/As_a_service

## YAML101 - YAML AINT MARKUP LANGUAGE

YAML (a recursive acronym for "YAML Ain't Markup Language") is a human-readable data-serialization language. It is commonly used for configuration files and in applications where data is being stored or transmitted.

It's used within AWS as one of two supported CloudFormation Template formats

This lesson is an introduction to YAML

## JSON101 - JavaScript Object Notation

JavaScript Object Notation is an open standard file format, and data interchange format, that uses human-readable text to store and transmit data objects consisting of attributeâ€“value pairs and array data types

It's used within AWS as one of two CloudFormation template formats and for identity and resource policies.

This lesson is a high level introduction to JSON.

## Encryption 101 - PART1 & PART2

In part 1 of this lesson I step through the difference between encryption at rest, and encryption in transit.

I discuss the high level components of encryption and provide definitions

We look at Symmetric encryption - how it works, and what its limitations are

and we finish by evaluation Asymmetric encryption and how it addresses these problems.

In Part 2 of this lesson I step through the process of signing - and how it can help to prove identity using Asymmetric keys

and we finish up talking about steganography the processing of hiding data inside of something else.

## Network Starter Pack - EXTRA - Distributed Denial of Service (DDOS)

Distributed Denial of Service (DDOS) attacks are effective at disrupting web applications no matter their size.

They are generally initiated from networks of compromised machines known as Botnets.

They come in 3 common types...

Application Layer
Protocol Attacks
Volumetric Attacks
This lesson steps through the architecture of all 3 ... the attack method and the components used.

## Secure Sockets Layer (SSL) and Transport Layer Security (TLS)

Secure Sockets Layer (SSL) and Transport Layer Security (TLS) are what provides the encrypted communications for HTTPS and other encrypted connection oriented protocols. This lesson steps through how the handshake process works for TLS and some of the key components.

## Hash Functions & Hashing

This video steps through how hashing works , what it's used for and why it's really important as a supporting process for many other areas of tech. It also explains a critical MD5 vulnerability vs something more secure like SHA2-256.

## DNS 101 Miniseries

The Domain Name System (DNS) is a core part of most applications and IT systems. If you work as a developer, engineer, solutions architect, devops engineer, security engineer or in any other IT role - you HAVE to understand DNS. DNS uses a fairly complex hierarchical structure to allow scaling and delegation. In this series of videos I will step you through the functionality of DNS from what it does, why it's needed, how it works and elaborate on many of the core pieces of functionality.

In this video I will start by explaining what DNS does ... in super simple terms.

DNSSEC strengthens authentication in DNS using digital signatures based on public key cryptography. With DNSSEC, it's not DNS queries and responses themselves that are cryptographically signed, but rather DNS data itself is signed by the owner of the data.

This video steps through what benefits DNSSEC provides and one of the common attacks which can be conducted against DNS.

## Recovery Point Objective (RPO) and Recovery Time Objective (RTO)

Recovery Point Objective (RPO) and Recovery Time Objective (RTO) are essential concepts to understand in almost all areas of IT, Cloud and AWS. They inform much of the design choices relating to backups, restore and resilience within systems.
