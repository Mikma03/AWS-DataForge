# Machine Learning Engineering on AWS

This book provides an essential guide for professionals who want to manage and secure machine learning (ML) workloads on Amazon Web Services (AWS). Readers will learn to design, build, and secure automated MLOps pipelines using several AWS services such as Amazon Elastic Kubernetes Service, AWS Glue, AWS Lambda, Amazon Redshift, and AWS Lake Formation. The book covers essential concepts and step-by-step instructions for training and deploying TensorFlow and PyTorch models on AWS, using containers and serverless services for ML engineering requirements, building end-to-end MLOps pipelines, and applying cost optimization and privacy preservation techniques. This book is for machine learning engineers, data scientists, and AWS cloud engineers with prior knowledge of AWS, machine learning, and the Python programming language.
