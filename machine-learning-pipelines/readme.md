# Building Machine Learning Pipelines

This practical guidebook by Hannes Hapke and Catherine Nelson provides a comprehensive understanding of automating machine learning pipelines using the TensorFlow ecosystem. Data scientists, machine learning engineers, and DevOps engineers will learn how to go beyond model development to successfully productize their data science projects, while managers will better understand the role they play in helping to accelerate these projects. The guide covers techniques and tools that will help cut deployment time from days to minutes and how to work with data using TensorFlow Data Validation and TensorFlow Transform. Additionally, the book covers methods to analyze a model in detail using TensorFlow Model Analysis, examine fairness and bias in model performance, and learn privacy-preserving machine learning techniques.
