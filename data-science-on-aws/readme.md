The book titled "Data Science on AWS: Building Scalable Machine Learning Solutions" authored by Chris Fregly and Antje Barth is a practical guide for AI and machine learning practitioners to build and deploy data science projects on Amazon Web Services (AWS). The book demonstrates how to use the Amazon AI and machine learning stack to unify data science, data engineering, and application development to reduce cost and improve performance. The authors cover real-world use cases such as natural language processing, computer vision, fraud detection, and conversational devices. The book also covers automated machine learning using SageMaker Autopilot and a complete model development lifecycle for a BERT-based NLP use case. Additionally, it covers machine learning operations pipeline, real-time ML, anomaly detection, and streaming analytics using Amazon Kinesis and Managed Streaming for Apache Kafka. The book also provides best practices for security in data science projects and workflows, including identity and access management, authentication, and authorization.
